This debugging script is a pleasure to use. It does ones iteration Arch Linux in Termux from start to finish. It runs setupTermuxArch.sh, then removes all files that were installed.  A word of warning, the script can malfunction and wipe all the data in the $HOME directory.  To reproduce this effect, run two sessions of raf.sh. Finish one. Then exit the other.  Please use raf.sh with caution, ideally on a device dedicated to debugging setupTermuxArch.sh.
